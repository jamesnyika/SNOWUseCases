Scheduling is an out of the box capability that is provided with ServiceNow
In order to schedule batch file processing or transmission, [use case 7](https://github.com/jamesnyika/SNOWUseCases/blob/master/7-Sending%20data%20to%20an%20external%20Content%20Management%20System.md) on Export Sets shows how an export set job can be tied to a schedule

However, in general, ServiceNow has a job scheduling function available under 'Scheduled Jobs' in the filter navigation.
