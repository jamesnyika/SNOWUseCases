 # 20-Process Monitoring
 ServiceNow tracks running processes using the Workflow Context monitoring capability. A Workflow Context is the complete stack of 
 activities, variables and state of a running business process. 
 
 You can see all running processes and their data by going to filter navigation and typing 'Active Contexts'
 
 Below are some screenshots of that some of the monitors will show.
