# 11-Create Batch Files
This use case refers to the ability to 

Assemble business data from multiple process instances to create a batch file (CSV)

## Solution : Export Sets
Export sets allow you to push data from an instance to an external file.

You can export data to a remote system using a MID Server.
Note: You must use a MID Server from the Geneva release or later. Earlier MID Server releases do not support export sets. Export sets are not supported on MID Servers in a cluster.

See an example of Export sets in [use case 7](https://github.com/jamesnyika/SNOWUseCases/blob/master/7-Sending%20data%20to%20an%20external%20Content%20Management%20System.md)
