# 3-Validating XML against an XSD Schema

Any XML that needs to be validated will have to be done through the MID Server by importing and using a JAXB and other XML Libraries, as well as JMS Drivers to connect to message queues through the MID Server directly rather than through the workflow engine. For more information search MID Server under ServiceNow documentation.
