# Uploading XLS data
Uploading data into ServiceNow using XLS files is quite quick and straight forward

### Step 1 - Go to the list view
Click on any column heading hamburger icon (three lines)

### Step 2 - Ask Servicenow to generate a template file for you (based on your use case - insert or update)
* The Insert case will generate an empty file but all headers and possible values for fields already set up in the xls file.
* The update case will generate all the data already in the table.

### Step 3 - Wait
Large tables with many columns take a while to generate so be patient.
