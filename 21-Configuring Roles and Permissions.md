# 21-Configuring Roles and Permissions
Configuring roles and permissions for business data on forms is handled through :

## 1. Filters 
Filters are used to control what data is allowed to reach the screen. Consider the navigation items on the filter navigation. Many are filters on
lists of data. For example the image below shows a Security INcident filter that filters down incidents to only show those belonging to one of my team
Notice too the filters at the top that were preset.

## 2. Data Policies
Data policies enable you to enforce data consistency by setting mandatory and read-only states for fields.

Data policies are similar to UI policies, but UI policies only apply to data entered on a form through the standard browser. Data policies can apply rules to all data entered into the system, including data brought in through import sets or web services and data entered through the mobile UI.
