# 19-Process Deadlines
ServiceNow does not  have the concept of a process deadline. 
Instead you use Service Levels to manage notifications and alerting for activites that breach the service level

 Each business process consists of a series of Activities. Each activity may spawn a task for a human to perform. Each task can then 
 be tied to a service level that takes into consideration the total time alotted for the activity and the whole process. These SLAs can then handle
 any alerting and notifications if they are breached.
