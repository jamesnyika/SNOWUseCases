# 17-Suspense Time on Tasks

Time on tasks can be managed through Service Levels in ServiceNow. Each task in ServiceNow is tracked from the moment it is created until it is completed.
Tasks can also spawn a service level tracker if so configured to allow the tracking of time by which the task must be complete.
Service Levels in ServiceNow can also be tied to a work schedule so that they only account for 'work hours', avoid counting holidays and weekends and
any other conditions that make sense for the business. 

### Example 1: Case - Priority 1 resolution (8 hour)
The screen below shows the configuration of a Priority 1 SLA that can be tied to a task to give it the desired feature for this use case
